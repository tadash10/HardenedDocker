    Create a new file called cli.sh with the following contents:



#!/bin/bash

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t docker-harden .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 80:80 docker-harden

    Make cli.sh executable:



chmod +x cli.sh

    Run the script:



./cli.sh

#This will build the Docker image using the Dockerfile and run the resulting container, which will start the harden_docker.py script and expose port 80. You can then access the script from your browser by going to http://localhost:80.
